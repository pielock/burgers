        <h2>The burger bun</h2>
            <p>So what constitutes the perfect burger?. First, it needs to have a good structure
            so that it can hold all of the lovely juices without falling apart. 2nd, even
            though the perfect bun is strong enough to hold all of that goodness, you also
            need to be able to bite through it without too much effort so that you can taste
            and chew the burger. You want those juices in your mouth, not on your lap.
            3rd The flavor of the bun needs to complement what's inside. A savory goodness of a juicy
            cheeseburger needs to be offset by the buttery sweetness of a phenomenal bread bun.</p>
        <h2>fillings</h2>
            <p>Now that we have the bun sorted, we need to look at the fillings. The most important
            part of a cheeseburger is the patty. The patty needs to be juicy, flavorful, and cooked to perfection.
            A good cheeseburger patty is typically made from ground beef, but you can also use other meats 
            like turkey, chicken, or even plant-based options for a vegetarian or vegan burger.
            The patty should be seasoned with salt and pepper, and cooked to your desired level of doneness.
            A good cheeseburger is not complete without cheese. The cheese should be melted and gooey,
            and should complement the flavor of the patty. Some popular cheese options for cheeseburgers 
            include cheddar, American, Swiss, and blue cheese. You can also add other toppings like lettuce,
            tomato, pickles, onions, and bacon to enhance the flavor and texture of the burger.
            Finally, a good cheeseburger needs a delicious sauce to tie everything together. Some popular
            sauce options include ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and barbecue sauce. You can also get creative
            and make your own special sauce using ingredients like mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, and spices.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the perfect cheeseburger is a combination of a delicious bun, a juicy patty,
            melted cheese, flavorful toppings, and a tasty sauce. With the right ingredients and preparation,
            you can create a cheeseburger that is sure to satisfy your cravings and leave you wanting more.</p>

        <h2>Cooking the perfect burger</h2>
            <p>To cook the perfect cheeseburger, start by preheating your grill or stovetop pan to medium-high heat.
            While the grill is heating up, season your burger patties with salt and pepper on both sides.
            Once the grill is hot, place the patties on the grill and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side for 
            medium-rare,or longer if you prefer your burgers more well-done. During the last minute of cooking, 
            add a slice of cheese on top of each patty and cover the grill or pan to allow the cheese to melt.
            While the burgers are cooking, you can also toast the burger buns on the grill for about 1-2 minutes
            until they are lightly browned. Once the burgers are cooked to your desired level of doneness,
            remove them from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes before assembling your cheeseburger.
            </p>
        <h2>Assembling your cheeseburger</h2>
            <p>To assemble your cheeseburger, start by spreading your desired sauce on the bottom bun. Next, add any 
            toppings you like, such as lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions. Then, place the cooked burger patty 
            with melted cheese on top of the toppings. Finally, add the top bun and press down gently to hold everything 
            together.</p>
