        <h1>Beef burgers</h1>
            <p>Beef burgers are a classic and popular choice for burger lovers around the world. Made from ground beef, 
            these burgers are known for their rich flavor and juicy texture. To make a delicious beef burger, it's 
            important to choose high-quality beef with a good fat content, as this will help keep the burger moist and 
            flavorful during cooking. Common seasonings for beef burgers include salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion 
            powder, but you can also get creative with other herbs and spices to suit your taste. When cooking beef burgers, 
            it's best to use a grill or a cast-iron skillet to achieve a nice sear on the outside while keeping the inside 
            juicy. Cook the burgers to your desired level of doneness, whether that's rare, medium-rare, medium, or well-done. 
            Once cooked, you can add your favorite toppings such as cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, and condiments 
            like ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise. Serve your beef burger on a toasted bun for the perfect meal that's sure to 
            satisfy your cravings.

        <h2>Beef burger recipe</h2>
            <p>Here is a simple recipe for making delicious beef burgers at home:</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb ground beef (80% lean)</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>4 burger buns</li>
            <li>Optional toppings: cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, ketchup mustard, mayonnaise</li>
            <li><strong>any thing else you like</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol> 
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix 
                    gently with your hands until just combined, being careful not to overwork the meat.</li>
                <li>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a patty about 3/4 inch thick. 
                    Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent it from puffing up during cooking.</li>
                <li>Preheat your grill or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. If using a grill, lightly oil the grates to 
                    prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes per side for medium doneness, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.
                    If you want to add cheese, place a slice of cheese on top of each patty and cover the grill or pan to allow the cheese to melt.
                    While the burgers are cooking, you can also toast the burger buns on the grill for about 1-2 minutes
                    until they are lightly browned. Once the burgers are cooked to your desired level of doneness,
                    remove them from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes before assembling your cheeseburger.</li>
                <li>To assemble your beef burger, start by spreading your desired sauce on the bottom bun. Next, add any 
                    toppings you like, such as lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions. Then, place the cooked burger patty 
                    with melted cheese on top of the toppings. Finally, add the top bun and press down gently to hold everything 
                    together.</li>
                <li>Serve the beef burgers immediately with your favorite side dishes, such as fries, coleslaw, or a salad.</li>
                <li><strong>Enjoy</strong>!</li>
